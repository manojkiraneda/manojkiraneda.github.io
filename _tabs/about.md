Hey there,

I'm Manojkiran Eda, and I'm all about diving deep into the tech world!

I've got a master's degree in embedded systems from [IIIT Bangalore](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/),
and these days, I work on a protocol called PLDM, & I maintain the
[openbmc/pldm](https://github.com/openbmc/pldm) repository.

I'm a true-blue tech enthusiast and a Linux lover, and you'll often
find me tinkering with electronic circuits just for the fun of it. I enjoy trying
out cool and crazy tech stuff, and my journey is all about exploring the beauty
of electronics, one byte at a time.

Let's keep pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the exciting world of
embedded systems!
